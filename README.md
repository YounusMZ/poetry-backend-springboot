# Poetry

Backend for [poetry-frontend](https://github.com/YounusMZ/poetry-frontend) made with Spring Boot. Alternative for [peotry-backend](https://github.com/YounusMZ/poetry-backend). Built for poets and poem enthusiasts, Poetry allows you to view random poems for the serendipity, search for poems and bookmark your favourites. Poetry provides a minimalist UI and allows migrating poems from a local JSON or CSV file. 

## Demo

- Live Site: https://poetry-backend-wv7w.onrender.com (Note: Render free-tier does not have persistent disk, so no changes are stored on sleep. It takes about a min to start up as well.)
- Run `docker pull ghcr.io/younusmz/poetry-backend:latest` to pull the docker image. Make a container and run. That's a quick way to spin it up.

## Description

## Features
* Migrate poems from CSV to local SQLITE database
* View random poems to find the ones you may have missed
* Search for poems by title
* Boomark your favourite poems
* Responsive UI - Use it on your phone!

## Tech Stack

**Frontend**
- React
- TypeScript
- React Bootstrap

**Backend**
- Java
- Spring Boot

**Database**
- SQLITE

**Deployment**
- Render

## How It Works

This is a full-stack web application with a React frontend that communicates with a REST API built with Express.

- The frontend handles UI and routing
- The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints
- Data is stored in the local SQLITE database

## Database Schema

- **poems**
  - id
  - title
  - poem
  - poet
  - tags
  - isBookmarked
  
## Getting Started
  
### Installation
To set up:
* clone the repository:
  `git clone https://github.com/YounusMZ/poetry-backend-springboot.git`
* move into the project directory: `cd poetry-backend-springboot`

### Executing program
To run:
* run `./gradlew bootRun` for development
* The build files for poetry-frontend are NOT currently provided with this repo. You need to run it separately.

 Or for production,
 * run `./gradlew clean build`
 * The build files will be in /build/libs.
 * go there and run `java -jar buildFileName.jar`. Make sure you've made a database folder where you're running it.

### Import JSON\CSV Schema
{\
&emsp;"id" : string,\
&emsp;"Title" : string,\
&emsp;"Poem" : string,\
&emsp;"Poet" : string,\
&emsp;"Tags" : string | null,\
&emsp;isBookmarked : boolean \
}

### API Endpoints

- Poem
  - `GET api/poem/:id`
  - `PUT api/bookmark/:id`
  - `GET api/search?poem=poemName&page=pageNumber`
  - `GET api/random`
  - `GET api/favourites?page=pageNumber`
  - `GET api/poems?ids=poemids`

### What I've learned
  - Worked with react bootstrap and gained more confidence in working with bootstrap. Learned to employ responsive design with bootstrap. 
  - Released the docker image of the app on GHCR.
